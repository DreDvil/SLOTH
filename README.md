## 🎯 Designed For

- AppSec / DevSecOps engineers  
- Pentesters / Red Team  
- Security researchers  
- Automated reconnaissance & initial security assessment  

---

## ✨ Key Features

- 🧩 Multi-tool orchestration  
- 🎛 Scan profiles: **fast**, **balanced**, **deep**  
- 🐢 Slow scanners isolated (Nikto / Nuclei)  
- 📊 Rich TUI (terminal UI):
  - live status (queued / running / done / failed)
  - progress bar
- 🧾 Clean, readable HTML reports
- 🔁 Continue working after scan completion
- ⚙️ Advanced configuration
- 🔌 Custom scanner selection
- 🚫 No fragile stdout parsing (stable execution)

## 🔧 Integrated Tools

| Tool        | Purpose                         |
|------------|----------------------------------|
| subfinder  | Subdomain enumeration            |
| whatweb    | Technology fingerprinting        |
| sslscan    | TLS / SSL analysis               |
| nmap       | Ports, services, scripts         |
| dirsearch  | Directory brute-force            |
| nikto      | Web vulnerabilities *(slow)*     |
| nuclei     | Template-based checks *(slow)*   |

## 🚀 Installation

### Requirements

- Python **3.10+**
- Linux (Kali / Ubuntu / Debian)
- Installed tools:
  - `nmap`
  - `subfinder`
  - `whatweb`
  - `sslscan`
  - `dirsearch`
  - `nikto`
  - `nuclei`

### Python dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
---
### Usage
```
python start.py
```
On first run:
	- config.yaml is generated automatically
	- Missing tools can be verified/installed from the menu

---

### 🧭 Main Menu

	1  Set target
	2  Choose profile (fast / balanced / deep)
	3  Select scanners (custom subset)
	4  Run scan (selected / ALL fast)
	5  Run slow scans (Nikto / Nuclei)
	6  Advanced settings
	0  Exit

---

### ⚡ Scan Profiles

fast (default)
	- quick reconnaissance
	- short timeouts
	- Nikto / Nuclei excluded

balanced
	- deeper checks
	- moderate timeouts
	- suitable for regular audits

deep
	- maximum coverage
	- long timeouts
	- recommended only for targeted scans

---

### 🐢 Slow Scanners Strategy

Nikto and Nuclei are intentionally separated because they:
	- can run for a long time
	- may trigger WAF / rate limits
	- significantly increase scan duration

They are:
	- ❌ NOT part of ALL
	- ▶️ executed explicitly via menu
	- ⏱ protected by step-level timeouts
	- ⚠️ clearly marked as slow

---

📄 Reports

After each scan:

scans/
└── YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS_target/
    ├── raw/
    └── reports/
        └── report.html

HTML report includes:
	- step summary table
	- execution time
	- status per scanner
	- scanner output (tail)
	- links to raw logs

No horizontal scrolling, readable on any screen.

⚙️ Advanced Settings

concurrency_targets	- Future multi-target support
skip_existing -	Skip existing artifacts
fail_fast - Stop pipeline on error
seclists_path - Custom SecLists path

---

🛣 Roadmap
	- Parallel step execution
	- JSON API
	- Export to information aggregator
 	- Docker image
	- YAML-driven pipelines
